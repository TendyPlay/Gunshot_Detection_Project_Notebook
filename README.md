# Gunshot_Detection_Project_Notebook
Attempts to run code from https://github.com/gabemagee/gunshot_detection in Google Colab 

This is what I've been able to get running as of right now.

Keep in mind, you will need to go to https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/2KI6IH and save the following files:

1D.tflite
128_x_64_2D.tflite
128_x_128_2D.tflite
augmented_labels.npy

Save somewhere on your drive/cloud for quick access, because once you close the session down and try to retart it at another time, you will need to rerun everything in order to run the code, and the files that you uploaded will be wiped.
